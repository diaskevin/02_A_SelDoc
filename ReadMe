Selenium 4 Automation Test Coverage

The aim of this project is to provides Automation Test coverage for Selenium4, with specified coverage of Java docs <<URL>>

Convention:
WebDriver created as a global variable with no access modifiers (i.e. leave blank so that it is 'Protected', without stating Private or Public)
QA desktop folder with sub-folders for projectShare(/resource, /library, /applicationSoftware) & projectTools(/Git, /Java, /Maven)
Junit5 annotations @Test @BeforeEach

Configuration:
Driver Location currently hard coded in repository <<>> (wip: Helper utility to store the location addreess of the driver)
Dependencies resolved by Maven (Selenium4, Junit 5 & Hamcrest)

REPOSITORY Problems:
     CH003&9 Kev_Framework GitHub Remote Repository
				CH01-10 Projects have Chrome baseline for System setProperties Ch 01-10 (each includes Read me notes)
			    CH01-10 Each Chapter has a Package 'Runner99' with NO SystemSet properities (i.e. Can clone running on any Selenium server)
             Problem A1: Driver Resource
			    HP_Laptop Local machine 'Resource' QA folder with BrowserType Driver executables
			    HP_Laptop Local machine 'Environmental System Variables' for System setProperty locations of each BrowserType Driver
			 Problem A2: Driver Set
			    HP_Laptop_Local machine Project created with a pre-requisite Browser Utility for runner 99's classes (incl Chrome, Edge, Opera & Safari)
			    (Alt: JFrog artifactory)
			 Problem B: IDE Types & gitignore (Eclipse & Intellij & VSC)
			    Ch10- Understand the Git Ignore at Push to rerpository
			    Github 'Package' can be transfered across IDE Types (by CopyPaste or GitCloned or ZipExport)
				Runner99 can be cloned and added to locally and pushed back to GitHub easily across IDE Types
             Problem C: Dependency Resolution
			    Java_Project JAR for each IDE_type (Eclipse & Intellij & VCS)
                Maven_Project POM for each IDE_type (Eclipse & Intellij & VCS)
             Problem D: Version control (Selenium, Java, Windows)
			    Chrome Driver stopped running and needed a ChromeOption: Fixed by Selenium jar 'Selenium-java' replaced s'Selenium-standalone'
                Grid requires Java version 11 (not version 8)
				Grid requires Win11 not Win10

WebDriver Interface
		// IntelliJ Observer (Point mouse on ChromeDrive, Ctrl + Click)
		// IntelliJ Observe ChromeDriver class opens to display ChromeDriver extends ChromiumDriver
		// Then... ChromiumDriver extends RemoreDriver, which in turn implements WebDriver (whic is an interface)


Selenium COVERAGE SUMMARY
Selenium4 functionality is defined by Java docs
